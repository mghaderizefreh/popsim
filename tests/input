! This is a sample input file.
! Lines that start with exclamation mark are skipped.
! empty lines are also skipped.

! [int] verbosity: '1' = produces lots of information,
! else = quiet
1

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! genomic information !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!! most of the inputs in this part may no not need to be changed
! [int] number of chromosome
26

! [*] base-name for genepool with integer representation of
! genes the number of individuals must be greater than number 
! of animals the format should be <basename><xxx> with xxx
! starting from 001 (limit of 100 characters; 
../data/original.ch

! [*] base-name for gene positions same format as above
../data/SNPpositions.t

! [real] length of chromosome (assuming all equal length)
1.0

! [real] mutation rate (scientic notations are accepted)
1.e-6

! [int] number of QTLs on each chromosome
500

! [int] number of SNPs on each chromosome (excluding QTL)
1000

! [int] randomQTL: 1 = QTLs will be selected randomly,
! else = QTLs will be selected
! from the alleses with MAF above a certain threshold
1

! [real] MAF for QTL selection. If randomQTL = True,
! this will be ignored, otherwise
! MAF must be in interval [0,0.5)
0.05

! [*] base-name for frequency files. If randomQTL = True this
! will be ignored, otherwise
! as many files are required as there are chromosomes
freq.txt


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! genetic infomration !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!! Information for genetic traits are here 
! [int] number of components, i.e., number of traits
6

! Correlation structure
! (ncomp-1)*ncomp/2 x [real] (ncomp = # of components)
! if ncomp = 1, this input is not read and next input is expcted.
! for ncmop > 1 , (ncomp - 1)*ncomp/2 inputs need to be in the order row-sie 
! for the lower triangle (column-wise for the upper), e.g., 
! corr(2,1)
! corr(3,1)
! corr(3,2)
! corr(4,1)
! corr(4,2)
! corr(4,3)
! ...
! ...
! corr(ncomp,1)
! corr(ncomp,2)
! ...
! corr(ncomp,ncomp-1)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! population information !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! [int] number of animals in pedigree
! NOTE THTAT IF THIS NUMBER IS SMALLER THAN THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF LINES IN THE 
! PEDIGREE FILE, THE REST OF THE FILE IS SKIPPED.
800

! pedigree file (in the form id, father, mother) (should not have header)
../data/pedigree.txt

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! output information !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! output filename for G matrix
gmatrix.txt

! output filename for TBV
tbv.txt

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! debugging files !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! I included these files (specially QTL) for debugging puposes
! Save QTL in QTLlist.txt file? (1 = yes, default = no)
! QTLs are standardised with the same correlation as expected for tbv
1
! Save SNP in SNPlist.txt file? (1 = yes, default = no)
